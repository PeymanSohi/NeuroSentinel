# üß† NeuroSentinel  
### Powered by AI, LLMs, Federated Learning, Threat Intelligence, and Forensics

---

## üîç Overview

This project is a **next-generation cybersecurity platform** designed to provide **autonomous, intelligent, and distributed defense** across multiple systems and networks. Combining the power of **machine learning**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **federated learning**, **threat intelligence APIs**, and **automated response mechanisms**, the platform detects, analyzes, and reacts to threats in real-time ‚Äî without human intervention.

Unlike traditional, centralized security solutions, this system empowers each node to monitor itself, learn local behavior, detect anomalies, and participate in a collaborative learning ecosystem ‚Äî all while preserving user privacy through **differential privacy**.

---

## üîë Key Features

- **Local Behavioral Anomaly Detection** using ML (AutoEncoders, Isolation Forest, etc.)
- **Federated Learning Engine** for collaborative model training across distributed nodes
- **Differential Privacy** to protect sensitive data while aggregating models
- **LLM-Powered Log Analysis** using local language models (LLaMA/Mistral) for natural language summarization of system events and security incidents
- **Autonomous Threat Response** (block malicious IPs, isolate processes, lock accounts, etc.)
- **Threat Intelligence Integration** with APIs like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and OTX for enrichment
- **Real-Time Forensic Snapshot** creation after threat detection
- **Web-Based Dashboard** (React/Vue) for monitoring agents, alerts, and analysis results
- **DevOps-Ready** with full Docker support, Prometheus/Grafana observability, and CI/CD pipelines
